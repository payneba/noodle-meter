# Noodle Meter

A web app to track how many miles Noodle the hamster runs each night.

## About

Running data is captured using a [Niteangel Hamster Wheel Pedometer](https://www.niteangel.com/) which counts wheel revolutions. The daily totals are logged in a Google Sheet and displayed here with fun visual effects based on performance.
